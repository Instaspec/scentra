For example, do you prefer lemon, lime, or grapefruit for the top notes? What would you like for the middle notes—perhaps something floral like jasmine or herbal like mint? Finally, how about the base: do you want a clean essence like cedarwood or a creamy scent like coconut? This will help precise the aroma profile."
