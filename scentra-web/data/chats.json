Are you looking to create a perfume, shampoo, candle, or something else?\n\nOnce we have that, we can explore the olfactive families that can give you that refreshing quality. Common choices for refreshing scents include:\n\n- **Citrus:** Bright and zesty (think lemon, lime, orange).\n- **Floral:** Light and uplifting (consider clean florals like lily or jasmine).\n- **Woody:** Earthy and grounding (think cedarwood or sandalwood).\n- **Herbal:** Invigorating and aromatic (like mint or basil).\n\nWhich product type are you interested in, and which olfactive family do you think aligns best with your idea of refreshing?"
